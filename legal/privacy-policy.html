        <p>Last revised: April 3, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Matt Hammond Inc. d/b/a AeroPoint ("AeroPoint") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it by complying with this Privacy Policy (the "Policy").</p>

        <p>This Policy describes the types of information AeroPoint may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website AeroPoint.com (the "Site") or otherwise engage with any content, functionality, services, or other online experiences offered under the AeroPoint trade name or otherwise on or through the Site (collectively with the Site, the "Service"), as well as our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. This Policy is an integral part of our End User Terms of Service, located at https://aeropoint.com/legal/eula (the "EULA"), which govern your use of and access to the Service. When completing the initial registration process for your user account, you agree to be bound by the EULA, including this Policy. Any capitalized term used, but not defined, in this Policy has the definition given to such term in the EULA</p>

        <p>This Policy applies to information about Users that AeroPoint collects, processes, or generates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>on or through the Service;</li>
          <li>from or on behalf of Customers in relation to the Service;</li>
          <li>in email, text, and other electronic messages between you and the Service; and/or</li>
          <li>through mobile and desktop applications you download from the Site or through the Apple App Store, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It does not apply to information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>collected by AeroPoint offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Matt Hammond Inc. or any third party;</li>
          <li>maintained, collected, or processed by any Customer, except to the extent such information is provided to AeroPoint as described in this Policy;</li>
          <li>disclosed to any portion of the Site that can be viewed by the public (or by other Users generally), or information disclosed directly to another User; or</li>
          <li>maintained, collected, or processed by any third party, including through any application or content that may link to or be accessible from or on the Site.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please read this Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how AeroPoint will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is to not use our Service in any capacity. By accepting the EULA and accessing or using any part of the Service, you agree to this privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to time (see "Changes to Our Privacy Policy" below) without notice to you (except to the extent required by law). Unless additional steps are required by applicable law or otherwise described in this Policy, your continued use of the Service after AeroPoint makes such changes is deemed to be your acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.</p>

        <h2>Choices About How AeroPoint Uses and Discloses Your Information</h2>
        <p>AeroPoint strives to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us. AeroPoint has created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>

        <h3>Access to Information</h3>
        <p>Twice per twelve (12) month period, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months from the date we receive your request. Once we receive and confirm your request (or a request on your behalf from an authorized agent or representative), we will disclose to you or such personal representative:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the categories of Personal Information we collect;</li>
          <li>the categories of sources of the Personal Information we collect;</li>
          <li>our business or commercial purpose for collecting such Personal Information;</li>
          <li>the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed the category of Personal Information for a business or commercial purpose;</li>
          <li>the business or commercial purpose for which we sold or disclosed the category of Personal Information; and</li>
          <li>the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you in a form that you can take with you (a "Data Portability Request").</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Correction of your Information</h3>
        <p>You can review and change your Personal Information by logging into the Site and visiting your account profile page.</p>

        <p>You may also send us an email at info@aeropoint.com to request access to, correct or delete any Personal Information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your Personal Information except by also deleting your User account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>

        <h3>Deletion/Erasure Requests</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we request from you and retain, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and verify your request, we will delete and direct our service providers to delete your Personal Information from our records. We may deny your deletion request if an exception applies or if retaining the Personal Information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a product or service you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;</li>
          <li>detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity or prosecute those responsible for such activity;</li>
          <li>debug to identify and/or repair errors that impair existing intended functionality of the Service; and/or</li>
          <li>enable solely internal and lawful uses of such Personal Information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The rights and choices in this section do not apply to you if the information being collected is aggregated consumer information, de-identified consumer information, or publicly available information.</p>

        <p>California residents may have additional Personal Information rights and choices. Please see for more information.</p>

        <h3>Requests to Exercise Your Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>
        <p>To exercise your rights to access, data portability, deletion, or any other rights mentioned in this Policy, you or your authorized agent may submit a verifiable request to us by using the contact information below.</p>

        <p><u>Address:</u> PO Box 154<br>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>AeroPoint has implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.</p>

        <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you.
