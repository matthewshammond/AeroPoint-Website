        <p>These Master Service Subscription Terms (including any applicable Schedules and Exhibits hereto or other terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein "Master Terms") govern any Order Form that references them and are made and entered into by and between the entity named as the "Customer" in the Order Form ("Customer") and Matt Hammond Inc. d/b/a AeroPoint ("Vendor").</p>

        <h1>Master Terms</h1>
        <p>Last revised: April 3, 2025</p>
        <p>Vendor and Customer agree as follows:</p>

        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
        <p>The capitalized terms used in this Agreement, including these Master Terms or any Order Form, will have the corresponding meanings provided in the <a href="#defined-terms">Defined Terms</a> section.</p>

        <h2>2. Agreement Structure; Services</h2>
        <h3>2.1</h3>
        <p>It is the intention of the parties that all Subscriptions for the Services purchased by Customer, including its Specified Affiliates, will be reflected on Order Forms issued pursuant to and governed by these Master Terms. Each such Order Form will govern only the Services ordered pursuant to such Order Form.</p>

        <h3>2.2</h3>
        <p>Vendor will make the applicable Services available for Customer's and its Users' use pursuant to this Agreement during each Subscription Term. Subject to Customer's satisfaction of payment obligations, Vendor's Services will include a browser interface as well as access to, and storage of, data on equipment owned or operated by or on behalf of Vendor and transmission of data from such equipment.</p>

        <h3>2.3</h3>
        <p>Vendor reserves the right, from time to time, to make Modifications to the Service, Content, or Vendor Technology that do not materially diminish the functionality or any mutually agreed upon configuration of the Service during the Subscription Term. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Vendor and Customer, each such Modification may be made generally available to all Vendor customers that subscribe to the applicable Service.</p>

        <h3>2.4</h3>
        <p>Services may be made available through a Mobile Application, which allows Customer and its Users to use and access a Service (or certain features or functionality thereof) via a mobile or tablet device. To use any Mobile Application, the applicable User must have a mobile or tablet device that is compatible with such Mobile Application. For clarity, such access and use of the Service (or any portions thereof) through a Mobile Application will be subject to this Agreement. If Customer accesses or uses an application that is operated or published by Vendor and posts or links to these Master Terms through an Apple device running iOS ("iOS App"), the following additional terms are applicable to such Customer and are incorporated into these Master Terms by this reference:</p>

        <h4>2.4.1</h4>
        <p>Customer acknowledges that these Master Terms are concluded between the Customer and Vendor only, and that Vendor, and not Apple, is responsible for providing the Services and any content thereof.</p>

        <h4>2.4.2</h4>
        <p>Customer may only access an iOS app through Apple-branded products that Customer owns or controls and as permitted by the usage rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service (currently available at ); provided that an iOS App may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with Customer via Family Sharing or volume purchasing.</p>

        <h4>2.4.3</h4>
        <p>Customer acknowledges that Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services to Customer with respect to any iOS App. To the extent that any maintenance or support is required under applicable law, Vendor, and not Apple, is obligated to provide such maintenance and support.</p>

        <h4>2.4.4</h4>
        <p>In the event a warranty obligation is not disclaimed under these Master Terms or Attachments and/or cannot be disclaimed under applicable law, Vendor, and not Apple, is responsible for providing such warranty. If an iOS App fails to conform to an applicable warranty, Customer may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the iOS App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to an iOS App.</p>

        <h4>2.4.5</h4>
        <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer acknowledges that, solely as between Apple and Vendor, Vendor is responsible for addressing any claims Customer may have relating to the Services, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Services fail to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy or similar legislation.</p>

        <h4>2.4.6</h4>
        <p>If the Services are alleged to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, Vendor, and not Apple, is responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

        <h4>2.4.7</h4>
        <p>Customer agrees to comply with any third-party terms applicable to Customer's use of an iOS App.</p>

        <h4>2.4.8</h4>
        <p>Customer acknowledges and agrees that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Master Terms and that Apple has the right to enforce this Section 2.4 against Customer as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>

        <h3>2.5</h3>
        <p>During the Subscription Term, Vendor will provide, free of charge, reasonable technical Support to assist the Customer in utilizing the Service. Customer shall reasonably cooperate with Vendor's provision of Support by providing such information and access to Customer resources as Vendor may reasonably require in order to provide such Support.</p>

        <h3>2.6</h3>
        <p>During the Subscription Term, Customer will be entitled to receive all Maintenance provided by Vendor. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, Vendor may provide Maintenance (including the implementation and deployment of Updates and Upgrades in Vendor's production environment) at such times as Vendor deems appropriate or necessary, without notice to Customer. Customer acknowledges that Vendor may from time to time deploy Updates or Upgrades of any Mobile Application, and in certain cases, Vendor may automatically and remotely implement and deploy Updates or Upgrades to the version of such Mobile Application that Customer and its Users are using on their respective mobile devices. Customer consents (on behalf of itself and its Users) to any such automatic and remote implementation and deployment on the mobile devices of Customer and its Users.

        <h2>3. License by Vendor</h2>
        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Vendor hereby grants Customer, during the applicable Subscription Term, a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in compliance with Section 18), non-sublicensable, worldwide:</p>

        <h3>3.1</h3>
        <p>right to access and use the Service, solely for use by Users in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Such use is limited to Customer's internal use;</p>

        <h3>3.2</h3>
        <p>license to use the Documentation solely for Customer's internal business purposes in connection with its use of the Service.</p>

        <h2>4. License by Customer</h2>
        <h3>4.1</h3>
        <p>Customer hereby irrevocably grants to Vendor, its Affiliates, and each of their respective Personnel all rights and permissions in or relating to Customer Data, any Third Party Applications or Third Party Materials provided or made available by Customer, in each case, as necessary for any of them to enforce this Agreement (to the extent permitted hereby), exercise their respective rights, and perform their respective obligations, including integration with a Third Party Application in accordance with Section 6 below. Subject to the limited rights and licenses granted herein, Vendor acquires under this Agreement no right, title, or interest from Customer or its licensors in or to any Customer Data, Third Party Application or Third Party Materials.</p>

        <h3>4.2</h3>
        <p>In addition, Customer hereby grants to Vendor and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into the Service any suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, bug report, correction or other feedback provided to Vendor or its Affiliates or its or their Personnel by Customer, its Affiliates, or Users relating to the operation of the Service. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Vendor will own and retain all right, title, and interest in and to any Intellectual Property Rights in any Modification that incorporates any such suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction or other feedback into the Service, and Customer will, and will cause its and its Affiliates' Personnel to, upon Vendor's request, assign to Vendor in writing any proprietary interest in any Modification.</p>

        <h2>5. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
        <p>Customer shall, and shall cause its Users to, comply with the Acceptable Use Policy, which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>

        <h2>6. Third Party Applications and Links</h2>
        <h3>6.1</h3>
        <p>Vendor may offer under an Order Form or may otherwise agree to provide the capability for a Service to integrate with one or more Third Party Applications via an application programming interface ("API") or other form of integration determined by Vendor. Customer acknowledges that it may be required, prior to using any such integration, to (a) obtain access to such Third Party Applications directly from their respective providers and any other consents or authorizations required for the use thereof, and (b) grant Vendor access to Customer's account(s) on those Third Party Applications. Any services and exchanges of data between Customer and any provider of a Third Party Application are solely between Customer and the applicable third-party provider. Vendor does not warrant or support third-party products or services (including Third Party Applications), whether or not they are designated by Vendor as "certified" or otherwise. Vendor will not be responsible for any disclosure, modification, or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by a Third Party Application. Vendor reserves the right to limit the number of interactions between the Service and a Third Party Application ("API calls") and the number of requests for information from specific fields (each a "data point") in the context of such interactions. Those limits and the additional fees due for exceeding the limits will be described in the Order Form. Customer acknowledges that exceeding the agreed limits for data point requests may result in Service degradation for Customer, and Customer is not entitled to any credits for periods during which Customer and its Specified Affiliates exceed the limits.</p>

        <h3>6.2</h3>
        <p>Vendor Technology and the Service may include links (whether background or external) to, or other means of accessing, Third Party Materials. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Third Party Materials are offered and made available by the applicable third party licensor, and not by Vendor, and, as such, may be used, edited, reproduced and distributed by such third party provider outside the scope of this Agreement and without Vendor's knowledge, endorsement, or control. The use of Third Party Materials is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and those of the third party provider. VENDOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY MATERIALS OR ANY USE THEREOF BY CUSTOMER OR ANY USER.</p>

        <h3>6.3</h3>
        <p>Vendor may immediately discontinue providing any integration with any Third Party Application or any link or other access to Third Party Materials if Vendor, in its sole discretion, determines that it no longer has the right or ability to provide such integration or link for any reason. Customer will notify Vendor promptly if Customer's relationship with any relevant third party provider terminates. Customer agrees that loss of an integration with Third Party Applications or link or access to Third Party Materials does not terminate, suspend, or reduce fees with regard to Customer's affected Subscriptions.</p>

        <h2>7. Customer's Responsibilities</h2>
        <h3>7.1</h3>
        <p>Customer will, and will ensure that its Users, use the Service, Content, and Vendor Technology, as applicable, in all material respects in accordance with this Agreement, any applicable Documentation, and any Policies. Customer will be solely responsible for its Users' use of and access to the Service, Content, and Vendor Technology, as applicable, and for all activity (including misuse or unauthorized use) occurring under its User Access Credentials to the extent not caused by Vendor or its Personnel. Customer will implement appropriate security and monitoring policies with respect to such use and access. Customer will ensure that all Users agree to and abide by the end user license agreement ("End User Terms of Use") posted on the Service or provided otherwise in writing. Customer will: (a) notify Vendor immediately of any known or suspected security breach involving the Service or unauthorized use of any Access Credentials, and (b) cooperate with Vendor and use reasonable efforts to stop immediately any unauthorized access to, or copying or distribution of the Service, the Content, Vendor Technology, or Customer Data.</p>

        <h3>7.2</h3>
        <p>Upon Vendor's provision of Access Credentials for the initial Subscription Administrator, Customer will be responsible for creating and managing Access Credentials for Users. Customer may designate only competent, trained Users as Subscription Administrators. An authorized Subscription Administrator may add User Accounts to an existing Subscription through the Service, and any added User Accounts or additional recurring services will be coterminous with the then-current preexisting Subscription Term for the applicable Service. Subscriptions cannot be shared by Affiliates, and each Affiliate of Customer whose data is uploaded to the Service must have its own Subscription. Affiliates may be added as additional Specified Affiliates only by execution of an additional Order Form. User Accounts and Access Credentials cannot be used by more than one individual User, but User Accounts (with new Access Credentials) may be reassigned from time to time to new Users who are replacing former Users. Customer will limit access to its Access Credentials to Users and will not share, reassign, divulge or disclose any Access Credentials except as permitted hereunder. Customer may not provide Access Credentials to third party representatives, consultants, contractors, or agents without the prior written consent of Vendor. Vendor will be entitled to rely on the instructions of the Subscription Administrator without further inquiry to or approval from Customer.</p>

        <h3>7.3</h3>
        <p>Customer is solely responsible for all of its and its Users' information technology infrastructure and networks, whether operated directly by Customer or through the use of third-party services. In addition to other third party costs that may apply, Customer agrees to pay for any and all of its telecommunications costs, license fees, and service fees required for Customer's and its Users' access to the Service, including in connection with establishing a secure connection (such as VPN) to the Service, where required.</p>

        <h3>7.4</h3>
        <p>Customer will cooperate reasonably and in good faith with Vendor in the performance of its obligations, including by allocating sufficient resources and timely performing any tasks and responding to any inquiries reasonably necessary to enable Vendor to perform its obligations under each Order Form. Vendor is not responsible or liable for any delay or failure of performance caused in whole or in part by Customer's delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement.</p>

        <h3>7.5</h3>
        <p>Customer shall be liable and responsible under the applicable Order Form for all Specified Affiliates of Customer that obtain Subscriptions to the Service in accordance with the Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) customer is responsible for compliance by such Specified Affiliates and their respective Users with the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement; (b) Subscription Administrators are not limited to exercising their authority with respect to any Specified Affiliate Subscription and will be permitted to act in accordance with the Agreement with respect to all Subscriptions under an order Form; (c) any reporting by Vendor that is not downloaded from the Service will be provided only to Customer, regardless of the Specified Affiliate(s) that are the subject of such reporting; and (d) Vendor will invoice Customer for all Subscriptions (including Specified Affiliate Subscriptions) under an Order Form, and Customer will be solely responsible for payment of such invoices.</p>

        <h2>8. Customer Data</h2>
        <h3>8.1</h3>
        <p>Vendor does not own any Customer Data, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Customer shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all Customer Provided Data, and for securing any necessary rights for all Customer Provided Data. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Vendor will not disclose Customer Data to any third party without Customer's prior consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. Vendor shall process Customer Provided Data only as permitted under this Agreement. Customer acknowledges and agrees that all Customer Data may be transferred by Vendor, without further consent from or notice to Customer, in connection with a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of Vendor's assets relating to the AeroPoint business or any merger, reorganization, or other operation of law.</p>

        <h3>8.2</h3>
        <p>Upon Customer's written request (which must be made during the Subscription Term or by the thirtieth (30th) day after termination of this Agreement in its entirety for any reason) and payment in full of all undisputed outstanding invoices at Vendor's then-current rates, Vendor will promptly retrieve and make available to Customer a digital backup file in the standard output format from the Service. After such thirty (30) day period, unless legally prohibited, Vendor may delete all Customer Data in its possession or under its control but will be permitted to retain indefinitely all data that has been made publicly available without breach of this Agreement. Vendor may charge an additional fee for the additional costs required in preparing any backup file that is to be delivered via a method other than downloading or in a format other than the standard output format from the Service.</p>

        <h3>8.3</h3>
        <p>Vendor does not exercise editorial control over the content of any material created or accessible over or through the Service. However, Vendor reserves the right, without any obligation, to monitor Customer's use of the Service at any time, as it reasonably deems appropriate, and to remove any materials that, in Vendor's sole discretion, may be illegal, may subject Vendor to liability, may violate this Agreement, or are inconsistent with Vendor's purpose for the Service.</p>

        <h3>8.4</h3>
        <p>The Service does not replace the need for Customer to maintain regular data backups or redundant data archives. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, VENDOR HAS NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, ALTERATION, DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, OR RECOVERY OF CUSTOMER DATA.</p>

        <h3>8.5</h3>
        <p>Customer understands and agrees that Customer Data provided by Customer for use by the Deconfliction Service is shared with all other customers, and the accuracy, currentness, and completion of such information is necessary to ensure the functionality of the Deconfliction Service. Customer grants Vendor, its Affiliates and their respective Personnel the right to use and disclose Customer Data provided by Customer through the Deconfliction Service for the purpose of providing the Deconfliction Service to all customers who subscribe to the Deconfliction Service and all users of such customers. Customer represents and warrants that all information and Customer Data provided by Customer for use in connection with the Deconfliction Service is accurate, current, and complete. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Vendor does not exercise editorial control over the content of any material created or accessible over or through the Service. Customer assumes all risk of Customer's reliance, and that of its Affiliates (including Specified Affiliates) and Users, on information provided through the Deconfliction Service.</p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property Ownership</h2>
        <h3>9.1</h3>
        <p>As between Vendor and Customer, Vendor shall exclusively own all right, title and interest, including all related Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Vendor Technology, the Content, the Service and any Modifications thereto (excluding any Customer Data incorporated into the Vendor Technology, the Content or the Service). All rights not expressly granted to Customer are reserved by Vendor and its licensors. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not convey to either party any rights, title, interest, or license in or related to the services, materials, content, technology, data, or Intellectual Property Rights of the other party or any third party.</p>

        <h3>9.2</h3>
        <h4>9.2.1</h4>
        <p>Unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement, neither party will use or display, nor permit any of such party's Affiliates or its or their Personnel to use or display, any Trademarks of the other party or any of such party's Affiliates, except when approved in writing by the other party. Any authorized use by a party of the other party's Trademarks will additionally be subject to such other party's quality usage guidelines that have been provided in writing.</p>

        <h4>9.2.2</h4>
        <p>Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to Vendor and its Affiliates a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the name and Trademarks of Customer and any Specified Affiliates using the Service: (a) as necessary to provide the Service, Maintenance, or Support, and (b) to identify that Customer is a customer of Vendor.</p>

        <h2>10. Fees</h2>
        <h3>10.1</h3>
        <h4>10.1.1</h4>
        <p>In consideration of Vendor's provision of the Services, Customer shall pay all fees or charges specified in all Order Forms hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Subscription Fees will be invoiced monthly or annually in advance (as specified in an Order Form), commencing on the first day of the applicable Initial Subscription Term. All other fees or charges specified in an Order Form will be invoiced at the rates in effect at the applicable time in accordance with the schedule set forth therein. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are nonrefundable, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

        <h4>10.1.2</h4>

        <h4>10.1.3</h4>

Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its use of Services or other activity hereunder, including those that Vendor is legally obligated to collect from Customer (subject to any valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority). For clarity, Vendor is solely responsible for Taxes assessable against it based on its income, property, and employees.</p>

        <h4>10.1.4</h4>

        <h3>10.3</h3>

        <h4>11.1.1</h4>
        <p>This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement, continues until the Subscription Terms for all Order Forms have expired or been terminated.</p>

        <h4>11.1.2</h4>
        <p>Each Order Form will be effective on the Order Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement, will continue for the Initial Subscription Term specified therein. After the Initial Subscription Term the Order Form will automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month periods (each, a "Renewal Term"), unless either party elects not to renew this Agreement, in whole or in part, by delivering written notice to the other party at least sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. Renewal Terms shall be subject to the fee increases described in Section 10.2.</p>

        <h4>11.1.3</h4>
        <p>Upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice, Customer may reduce the number of User Accounts, terminate the Subscription of one or more Specified Affiliates, or terminate an individual Service under any Order Form, effective only upon the expiration of the Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term for such Order Form.</p>

        <h3>11.2</h3>
        <h4>11.2.1</h4>
        <p>In the event that a party breaches any material provision of this Agreement and fails to fully cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice describing the breach, the other party may, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, immediately, upon providing written notice thereof, terminate each Order Form affected by such breach, in whole or in part. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer's payment obligations and its obligations under the Acceptable Use Policy will be deemed material provisions of this Agreement.</p>

        <h4>11.2.2</h4>
        <p>In addition, Vendor may terminate this Agreement immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) if either party ceases to do business, or otherwise terminates its business operations, or (b) if either party becomes insolvent, or seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trustee, creditor's arrangement composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against either party and not dismissed within thirty (30) days.</p>

        <h4>11.2.3</h4>
        <p>Vendor may also terminate any relevant Service under any Order Form without liability therefor, immediately by written notice to Customer in the event that a change in applicable Law requires a material change in the Service or the manner in which the Service is then provided, and Vendor cannot make such change (a) without incurring material costs that it is not willing to incur, or (b) within the time period as may be directed by applicable Law.</p>

        <h4>11.2.4</h4>
        <p>This Agreement and all Subscriptions and Order Forms may be terminated at any time if expressly agreed to in writing by both Customer and Vendor.</p>

        <h3>11.3</h3>
        <p>Effect of Termination. Any termination of these Master Terms automatically terminates all Order Forms then in effect. Any termination of a specific Order Form will not serve to terminate any other Order Form or (unless there are no other then-current Order Forms) these Master Terms. Upon expiration of the Subscription Term of any Service or termination of any Order Form, (a) Customer will promptly pay Vendor all amounts owed to Vendor for such Service, (b) the related rights and licenses granted herein to Customer and its Users will immediately terminate, and (c) Customer will, and will cause all Users to, immediately cease all use of the terminated or expired Service and all related Content and Vendor Technology. Sections 8.3, 9.1, 9.2.1, 10.1, 10.4, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 12.4, 13, 14, 16, 20, 22, 23, and any terms so designated in any Exhibit or Appendix to these Master Terms shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

        <h3>11.4</h3>
        <p>Refunds. Customer shall not be entitled to any refunds unless Customer terminates any Order Form in connection with an uncured Vendor breach pursuant to Section 11.2.1, or if Vendor terminates any Order Form pursuant to Section 13.3 below to mitigate a claim of infringement or misappropriation. Only upon such event, Vendor shall promptly refund to Customer a pro-rata (based on remaining days) portion of the Subscription Fees under the terminated Order Form for the then-current Monthly Billing Term or Annual Billing Term, as applicable.</p>

        <h3>11.5</h3>
        <p>Termination Assistance Services. In connection with any termination or expiration of each Order Form, if requested in writing by Customer, Vendor will provide the Customer Data to Customer or its designee(s) in accordance with Section 8.3.</p>

        <h3>12.4</h3>

        <h2>13. Mutual Indemnification</h2>
        <h3>13.1</h3>
        <p>Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Vendor, its Affiliates, and its and their respective licensors, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (collectively, "Vendor Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) incurred by a Vendor Indemnitee in connection with any third party claim, including any claim by any Personnel of Customer or its Affiliates, to the extent that such claim arises from (a) any use of or access to any Customer Data or Personal Data by Vendor, its Affiliates or their respective Personnel in accordance with this Agreement, (b) any breach, alleged breach, or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Customer, or any breach or alleged breach of any covenant or other obligation set forth in this Agreement, in each case, by Customer, its Affiliates, or any of its or their respective Personnel, (c) any use of or access to the Service, Content, Vendor Technology, Third Party Applications, or Third Party Materials by or on behalf of Customer (subject to Vendor's indemnification obligations in Section 13.2 below), (d) Vendor's provision of an integration or otherwise transmitting any data to a third party as authorized by Customer, including with respect to data security and use of data, (e) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Customer, its Affiliates, or any of its or their respective Personnel, or (f) any Excluded Claim (defined below).</p>

        <h3>13.2</h3>
        <p>Vendor will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer and its officers, directors, and employees, and each of their successors and assigns (collectively, "Customer Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) incurred by Customer in connection with any third party claim to the extent that such claim arises from an allegation that Customer's use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement infringes or misappropriates any U.S. patent, copyright, or trademark rights of such third party. However, Vendor shall have no obligation under this Agreement for Excluded Claims.</p>

        <h3>13.3</h3>
        <p>In the event the Service, Content, or Vendor Technology are, or, in Vendor's sole discretion, are likely to become, subject to a claim of infringement or misappropriation (except to the extent such claim is an Excluded Claim) of any Intellectual Property Right of a third party, Vendor, at its sole option and expense, shall (subject to the following sentence): (a) procure for Customer the right to continue receiving access to or using the Service, Content, or Vendor Technology, or (b) modify or replace the Service, Content, or Vendor Technology, in whole or in part, to be non-infringing, without materially reducing features and functionality, in which case such modifications or replacements will constitute Service, Content, or Vendor Technology, as applicable, under the Agreement. If neither of the foregoing two options is reasonably available to Vendor, Vendor may terminate the affected Order Form, in whole or in part, by notice to Customer. THIS SECTION, 13.3, TOGETHER WITH THE TERMINATION AND REFUND RIGHTS IN SECTION 11.2.1 AND SECTION 11.4, SET OUT CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND VENDOR'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTUAL, THREATENED, OR ALLEGED CLAIM THAT THE SERVICE, CONTENT, OR VENDOR TECHNOLOGY OR ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT INFRINGES, MISAPPROPRIATES, OR OTHERWISE VIOLATES ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>

        <h3>13.4</h3>
        <p>Indemnification Procedures. The indemnified party shall promptly give the indemnifying party notice of any claim subject to indemnification, but the failure to promptly notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced. Subject to this Section 13.4, the indemnifying party will assume control of the defense of such claim. The indemnifying party must not settle any claim without the indemnified party's written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. Each party shall provide the other with reasonable assistance in connection with any claim that is the subject of indemnification hereunder. The indemnified party may participate in the defense of any claim, at the indemnified party's option and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the indemnified party reasonably determines that a claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of indemnified monetary damages, the indemnified party may assume the defense of such claim at its expense; provided, that the indemnified party must not settle any claim without the indemnifying party's written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

        <h3>15.3</h3>
        <p>Customer may not use the Services, or provide any User with access to the Services, in any jurisdiction or territory in which use of the Services is prohibited by applicable Law or this Agreement. Vendor makes no representations or warranties that the Services, Content or Vendor Technology are appropriate or lawful in any jurisdiction or territory outside of the United States, or that any Services, Content, or Vendor Technology will be available outside the United States. If Customer accesses, or permits Users to access, the Services, Content or Vendor Technology from outside of the United States, Customer do so on its own initiative, and Customer is solely responsible for compliance with local Laws, if and to the extent local Laws are applicable.</p>

        <h2>16. Notices</h2>
        <h3>16.1</h3>
        <p>Notices by Vendor. Except as otherwise required by this Agreement, Vendor may give any notice required by this Agreement by means of a general notice on the Service or via email to Customer's email address on record in Vendor's account information. Notices provided via email will be deemed given and received on the transmission date of the email. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor shall provide Customer with notice in writing, by certified mail or overnight courier, return receipt requested, at the address specified in the Order Form with respect to any request for indemnification, notice of dispute, or notice of breach or termination.</p>

        <h3>16.2</h3>

        <h2>17. Modification to Terms and Policies</h2>
        <p>An Order Form may be modified only by mutual written agreement between the parties. Vendor reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, to update, revise, supplement, and otherwise modify these Master Terms or any Policies and to impose new or additional rules, policies, terms, or conditions on Customer's use of the Service. Vendor will communicate changes to these Master Terms by posting the new version on the Service or its website here, or as otherwise determined by Vendor in its sole discretion, at which time such updated Master Terms will be immediately effective. Customer is responsible for regularly reviewing these Master Terms and Vendor's Policies. Customer's continued use of any Services after such notification of changes to these Master Terms will constitute Customer's acceptance of any and all such changes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor will notify Customer of any material changes to these Master Terms.</p>

        <h2>18. Assignment; Change in Control</h2>
        <p>Customer may not assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Vendor, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void. No assignment, delegation, or transfer will relieve Customer of any of its obligations or performance under this Agreement. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Vendor may immediately terminate this Agreement for cause by written notice in the event Customer undergoes a change of control, or proposes to continue with a change of control despite Vendor's objection, in each case, that does or will result in Customer Controlling or being Controlled by, directly or indirectly, any direct competitor of Vendor.</p>

        <h2>19. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>Neither party to this Agreement shall be liable for its failure, delay, or hindrance in performing any of its obligations (other than payment obligations) hereunder to the extent such failure, delay, or hindrance is attributable to a Force Majeure Event. The party affected by such event or circumstance will promptly notify the other party of such failure, delay, or hindrance and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the effect of such event or circumstance on the performance of its obligations.</p>

        <h2>20. Confidential Information</h2>
        <p>Each party acknowledges that (i) the Service, Content and any databases incorporate confidential and proprietary information developed or acquired by Vendor and its licensors, (ii) the Customer Data constitutes the confidential information of Customer and (iii) each party may receive or have access to other proprietary or confidential information disclosed and marked as confidential by the disclosing party (collectively, the "Confidential Information"). The receiving party will use the disclosing party's Confidential Information solely to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Agreement. The receiving party will take all precautions necessary to safeguard the confidentiality of the disclosing party's Confidential Information. The receiving party will not disclose, in whole or in part, the disclosing party's Confidential Information to any Person, except to Persons authorized by the disclosing party to receive such information, including disclosures of Customer Data to customers subscribed to the Deconfliction Service pursuant to this Agreement, as well as to the receiving party's Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, (sub)contractors and service providers, agents, advisors and other representatives, if such disclosure is in further of performance under this Agreement and if such Persons are subject to restrictions no less protective of the disclosing party's Confidential Information as those contained in the Agreement. The parties acknowledge that any unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing party's Confidential Information may cause irreparable damage to the disclosing party. Confidential Information will not include information that (i) the receiving party independently developed without use of Confidential Information from the disclosing party, (ii) the receiving party lawfully obtained from a third party under no obligation of confidentiality, (iii) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of any wrongful act of the receiving party or any of its employees or agents, or (iv) was in the receiving party's possession prior to disclosure. If the receiving party is compelled to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to legal process in a court of competent jurisdiction, the receiving party will be permitted to disclose that portion of Confidential Information that is required to be so disclosed. In case of compelled disclosure, the receiving party will notify the disclosing party, to the extent legally permitted, before disclosing any portion of the disclosing party's Confidential Information to any other Person.</p>

        <h2>21. Vendor's Affiliates and Subcontractors</h2>
        <p>Vendor may use Affiliates or subcontractors to provide the Service, Content, and Vendor Technology, and Maintenance, Support, and other services related thereto. Vendor remains responsible for its Affiliates' and subcontractors' compliance with Vendor's obligations under this Agreement.</p>

        <h2>22. Contracting Entity, Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Subject to the remainder of this Section 22 below, any action arising under or in connection with this agreement may be brought in the Georgia State-Wide Business Court in the state of Georgia, United States of America; provided, that if the Georgia State-Wide Business Court shall lack jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court in Fulton County, Georgia (collectively, the "Permitted Courts") and the parties: (i) consent to the jurisdiction of the Permitted Courts in such actions and (ii) agree not to plead or claim that such litigation brought in the Permitted Courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. In any suit, arbitration, mediation, or other proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement or to interpret any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and all costs and fees incurred on appeal or in a bankruptcy or similar action.</p>

        <h3>(a) Cooperation</h3>
        <p>The parties agree that they will cooperate at all times in good faith. In the event of any dispute, which cannot be readily resolved within 30 days, the parties will each escalate the matter to their respective senior management who will meet in person or by telephone within 15 days of receipt of notice of the dispute, to attempt to resolve the open issues. The foregoing will not prevent either party from immediately seeking a temporary injunctive order or pursuing claims for indemnification in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

        <h3>(b) Arbitration</h3>
        <p>The parties agree that any dispute or claim that arises out of or relates in any way to the Agreement or the Service that is not resolved in accordance with Section 22(b) above will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Section 22. Such arbitration will be final and binding.</p>

        <h3>(c) Class Waiver</h3>
        <p>Any arbitration proceeding under this Section 22 will take place on an individual basis. Class arbitrations and class or representative proceedings of any kind are not permitted and Customer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) expressly waives its ability to participate in a class or representative proceeding against Vendor or its Affiliates. If the arbitration clause is found inapplicable to the dispute or claim, this class waiver will continue to apply in litigation. Customer agrees (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that this class waiver is an essential element of the agreement between Customer and Vendor and that this class waiver may not be severed. In the event that this class waiver is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire agreement to arbitrate in this Section 22 will be null and void.</p>

        <h3>(d) Arbitration Authority</h3>
        <p>Any dispute or claim subject to arbitration pursuant to this Section 22 must be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Rules. The arbitrator will be bound by and will strictly enforce the terms of this Agreement, including any limitations of liability contained herein, and may not limit, expand or otherwise modify any of the provisions of the foregoing. Any arbitration will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing. Each party will bear its own expenses in the arbitration and will share equally the costs of the arbitration; provided, however, that the arbitrator will award the applicable party any costs and fees to which it may be entitled under Section 13 in connection with any indemnification claim. Customer agrees that its transactions with Vendor evidence transactions in interstate commerce, and that the Federal Arbitration Act therefore governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 22 (notwithstanding the application of Georgia law to any underlying claims).</p>

        <h2>23. General</h2>
        <h3>23.1</h3>
        <p>Order of Precedence. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict in contract terms, unless a lower priority document expressly supersedes a higher priority document by specifically referencing the inconsistent or conflicting term, the order of precedence will be, from highest to lowest priority: (a) the terms appearing in the applicable Order Form; and (b) these Master Terms.</p>

        <h3>23.2</h3>
        <p>Relationship of the Parties. The parties are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement or otherwise will be deemed to create any partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between the parties or any of their Affiliates, agents, contractors, or subcontractors. The employees of Vendor will not be deemed to be employees of Customer, and the employees of Customer will not be deemed to be employees of Vendor.</p>

        <h3>23.3</h3>
        <p>Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as specified in the Agreement, the Agreement does not create any obligations of, or any rights, causes of action, or benefits, in favor of any Person other than Customer and its applicable Affiliates (and their respective successors and permitted assigns) and Vendor and its applicable Affiliates (and their respective successors and permitted assigns).</p>

        <h3>23.4</h3>
        <p>Publicity. Except as provided in Section 9.2.2, neither party may use the other party's Trademarks or otherwise refer to the other party, directly or indirectly, in any media releases, public announcements or promotional or marketing materials, without written approval from the other party, which may be given in such party's sole discretion. Approvals may be given via email.</p>

        <h3>23.5</h3>
        <p>Entire Agreement. The Order Form – including these Master Terms and any Attachments and Exhibits – constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such matters, whether oral or written. No terms stated in any other Customer purchase order, privacy agreement, vendor agreement or other Customer form agreement will be incorporated into or form any part of the applicable Order Form (including these Master Terms and any Attachments and Exhibits) unless such document is signed by an officer of Vendor, explicitly references such Order Form, and states that it is intended to modify such Order Form.</p>

        <h3>23.6</h3>
        <p>Interpretation. The headings used in the Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting the Agreement. The parties agree that the terms and conditions of the Agreement are the result of negotiations between the parties and that the Agreement will not be construed in favor of or against any party by reason of the extent to which any party or its professional advisors participated in the preparation of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise: (a) the words "include," "includes," and "including" are deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation", and (b) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto," and "hereunder" refer to the Agreement as a whole.</p>

        <h3>23.7</h3>
        <p>Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision(s), with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.</p>

        <h3>23.8</h3>
        <p>Non-Wavier. The failure or delay of a party to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by such party in writing.</p>

        <h3>23.9</h3>
        <p>Electronic Signatures. This Agreement and associated Order Forms and related documents may be executed and accepted by means of electronic or digital signatures. Any such electronic or digital signature will be deemed to satisfy all requirements imposed on electronic or digital signatures under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), and any similar Laws relating to the validity or enforceability of electronic or digital signatures.</p>
